/**
 * @dev Flare network <> XRPL, Aurei bridge contract
 * The purpose for this smart contract is to be able to issue the stablecoin AUR(Aurei) on XRP ledger in a
 * trustless manner backed by 1:1 with AUR on the flare network. This contract will lock up the AUR amount that is
 * to be issued in XRPL and users looking to hold AUR on XRPL should check this smart contract to verify that
 * the issuer has followed the procedure laid out below. If the issuer doesn't follow the procedure precisely,
 * they will be penalized by losing the AUR they deposited,  * and a portion of it rewarded
 * to the person that proved the misuse
 *
 *
 * The process to Issue AUR on XRPL:
 * - On XRPL, User need 2 XRPL accounts, 'issuer account' and 'receiver account'
 * - On Flare, User needs give Bridge contract (this contract) AUR allowance by amount they wish to issue on XRPL
 * - On Flare, lock up Aurei in this smart contract by calling 'newIssuer' with the XRPL issuer account address and amount
 * - On XRPL, create a trustline from 'receiver account' to 'issuer account' with 'amount' locked in bridgeContract
 * - On XRPL, set issuer account setting 'defaultRippling" to true and 'disableAuth' to false
 * - On XRPL, add regular key ACCOUNT_ONE to issuer account settings
 * - On XRPL, issue exactly the 'amount' from issuer account to receiver account
 * - On XRPL, set the issuer account setting 'disableMasterKey' to true
 * - On FLare, call stateConnector contract and prove the payment by calling 'provePaymentFinality' and provide the txHash on XRPL
 * - On Flare, call stateConnector contract and prove that the issuer account can no longer issue
 *        by calling 'TBD' (This feature has not been implemented)
 * - On Flare, call 'completeIssuance' on this contract which will complete the Issuer's issuance
 * - On Flare, call 'verifyIssuer' on this contract to verify that issuer can no longer issue
 *      anymore AUR (This can only be done after stateConnector has implemented the feature)
 *
 * The process to Redeem AUR on XRPL:
 * - On Flare, call redepmtionAttempt to pre-register an redemption attempt
 * - On XRPL, send the AUR back to the issuer by the amount you wish you redeem
 * - On Flare, call stateConnector contract and prove the payment has completed
 * - On Flare, call bridge contract's `redeemAUR` function to unlock the AUR
