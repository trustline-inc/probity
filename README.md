# Probity

[![Build](https://github.com/trustline-inc/probity/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/trustline-inc/probity/actions/workflows/build.yml) <img alt="NPM" src="https://img.shields.io/npm/l/@trustline/probity">

> Probity is a protocol for asset-based lending designed to run on EVM-compatible distributed ledgers.

You can view the contract code in the [`contracts`](./contracts) folder and the audit report can be found in the [`audits`](./audits) folder. You can find everything else in the protocol [documentation](https://docs.trustline.co/products/).

## Usage

This repository contains the source code for the Probity smart contract system and examples to jumpstart development with Probity. The contract ABIs are accessible through the [`@trustline/probity`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@trustline/probity) NPM package.

### Installation

This project uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and assumes you have it installed.

Add `@trustline/probity` to your project with `npm` or `yarn`:

```
npm install @trustline/probity --save
```

### Example

Below is a code snippet that shows how to import the contract ABI and call a contract method using [`ethers`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/).

```javascript
/**
 * This example gets the total supply of the USD token by
 * calling the `totalSupply` method on the ERC20 contract at
 * <address>.
 */
import UsdABI from "@trustline/probity/artifacts/contracts/tokens/Usd.sol/USD.json";
import { Contract } from "ethers";

const USD_ERC20_ADDRESS = "<address>";

const usdErc20 = new Contract(
  USD_ERC20_ADDRESS,
  UsdABI.abi,
  library.getSigner()
);
const totalSupply = await usdErc20.totalSupply();
console.log("Total supply:", totalSupply);
```
